## Project Description 
***
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augmented Reality aims to help customers find the perfect addition to their home by taking a product on popular furniture websites 
and using an in-room augmented reality experience on mobile to bring the item into their environment to see how it looks within their home, office, bedroom, or wherever 
the user can take their mobile device. This app is aimed for Android devices, and is tested using Anroid 11.0 on a Google Pixel 3a.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our project is built using Android Studio to build the UI and functionality of the app, and Unity is used to make the Augemented Reality portion of our app. We had issues
integrating the two together and creating an installation file for the app, the portion of Unity is maintained on Unity Hub.
